    <h1> A little Bit About Me</h1>
    
    <div id="font">My name is Nebiyat. I am 20 years old. I am a biolgy student at BHCC. I love Biology because it challenges me a lot. I always want to learn about living things and how our body functions. <br></br>Later on in life I got facinated with the work that software enginners and computer scientist do. I like how they develop websites, games, apps, etc. I wanted to be part of this to make websites and learn how to code. <br></br>I also realized how coding and knowing how to code helps and makes every person's life easy. I also see how computer scientist and software enginners and others in the computer field contributes to the tech, bussiness, and STEM world.

From the knowledge I get at the Gcode I am looking froward to learn
